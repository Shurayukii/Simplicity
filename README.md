## ARCHIVED DUE TO ME NOT BEING INTERESTED IN CODING ANYMORE + NOBODY USES IT ANYWAYS

## **New Description**

Since Version 3.0 i changed how i stored the files in Github so for my friends that use the Kernel Discord Client, Get their updates without having to move stuff in the files after every theme update so now to get to your specific custom theme click on your blue name to go to your branch or click "Click-Me!"
