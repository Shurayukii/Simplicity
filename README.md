## Getting Started

To use this theme you need a client mod or a browser plugin that allows you to load custom CSS. There are several possibilities, the first and recommended variant would be a client mod, for example [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord), [Better Discord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord) or [GooseMod](https://github.com/GooseMod/GooseMod).

However, we would like to point out that using a client mod could result in account termination, Discord is not actively taking action against client mod users at this time. If you have concerns about using a client mod, a CSS browser plugin like Stylus may be a better choice.


This theme can also be used with a browser extension like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), it can be used with [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium) based browsers, [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
